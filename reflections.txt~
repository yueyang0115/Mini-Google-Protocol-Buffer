1. Was there any particular type of task you overestimated/ underestimated time for? Can you say anything about what types of tasks you find especially hard to estimate? Do you have any insight into why?

I underestimated the time for deseriatization and serialization. I have no basic idea of how to write them until the very last time. There are too many situations that is likely to forget at the first time. I think it is because I am still a novie programming, lacking experience and having little idea of how to write such code.
I underestimated the time for hard coding. Maybe I use bad abstraction.

2. How well did you meet your intermediate deadlines?
I spend a lot time thinking about the structure of my code and the data structure I can use. But it still looks not that good...

3. Suppose your customer were to change the requirements now. How
easy/hard would
it be to accommodate the following changes. Why are these easy
or hard?
        o Instead of just producing Java code, your program must now
be accept an option for what language to produce code in:
Java,
to produce,
your program must also be able to accept XML files.
        o Your generated classes must be able to serialize/deserialize
into XML
as well as JSON
4. As you have been doing this assignment, you have been learning a
lot more
about object-oriented design. If you had known at the start
what you know
      now, would you have done anything differently?  Would any of the
design
      patterns we learned about in class have worked well in this
assignment?
5. What lessons did you learn from doing this assignment? How will
it inform
      your future software development in this class, other classes,
and/or
      your professional life?
